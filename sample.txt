LangChain and LangGraph are both Python-based frameworks for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs), but they differ in their focus and capabilities. LangChain provides a more general framework for developing LLM applications, simplifying development with its modular components and pre-built tools. LangGraph, on the other hand, specializes in building and managing complex, stateful agentic workflows, offering more control over state management and execution flow.
